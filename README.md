# InfiltrAIte - An Escape Room Game

## To setup OpenAI's API

- add in the root of the project (i.e., the same level where `pom.xml` is located) a file named `apiproxy.config`
- put inside the credentials that you received from no-reply@digitaledu.ac.nz (put the quotes "")

  ```
  email: "upi123@aucklanduni.ac.nz"
  apiKey: "YOUR_KEY"
  ```
  these are your credentials to invoke the OpenAI GPT APIs
